SLIDE: Title

Thank you _NAME_ and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.

### Acknoledgement of country

The first thing I'd like to do is acknowledge that we're gathered here today on the land of the Wauthaurong people of the Kulin nations and we pay our respects to elders past and present, and I acknowledge in particular any Indigenous guests with us today.

Congratulations. Congratulations on choosing a career path that has such enormous power to shape humanity in the future, and incredible opportunities for employment.

SLIDE: Maslow's wifi

Congratulations on choosing a career path that has the ability to shape and influence our everday lives given how incredibly dependent we are on technology.

SLIDE: Fourth industrial revolution

And it's a great career choice as globally, as we head into the fourth industrial revolution - driven by advances in technology such as artifical intelligence and machine learning, advanced manufacturing and 3D printing and nanotechnology. It really is an exciting time to be alive.
